# DSA Project
Tried to make a naive Text Editor for DSA project
Majorly, Doubly Linked list is used for all insertion , deletion operations
All of the operations don't go beyond O(N) 
Some of the functionalities include:
1. Searches for all occurrences of a word (tells how many times given word occurs in text file)
2. Deletes a word 
3. Deletes entire Lines from either beginning or end 
4. (Ofcourse) Create and write to a file

Pros :
Nothing

Cons:
Might crash
